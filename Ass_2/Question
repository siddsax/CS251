Suppose there are n students, m tas and d lab days (all numbered from 1 to ...).

There will be a list that dictates which student can take which lab day.
Create this list as a one-time measure using randomisation.

Create this using weights on the lab days, e.g., 10% on lab day 1, 30% on lab day 2, etc.
The weights may be read from a file f.

Each ta grades roughly w = n/m students.

Next, divide the tas between the d lab days (assume m > d) such that per day, roughly w students are graded by each ta.
In a day, the difference between the number of students graded by a ta cannot be more than 1.

Randomise the allocation of tas to the days.
In each day, randomise the students assigned to the tas.

Additionally, give the students slots starting from time t with a gap of g minutes each.

Running this script every week will solve the problem.

You can use *only* bash tools including grep, sed and awk.

Sample input:

n = 11
m = 4
d = 2
File f:
70
30
t = 2:00pm
g = 10 min

Sample output:

Students to lab days:

Day 1 students:
11
9
1
2
6
4
10
8

Day 2 students:
7
3
5

Day 1 mapping:
3 11 2:00
3 9 2:10
3 1 2:20
4 2 2:00
4 6 2:10
4 4 2:20
1 10 2:00
1 8 2:10

Day 2 mapping:
2 7 2:00
2 3 2:10
2 5 2:20
